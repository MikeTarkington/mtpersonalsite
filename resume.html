                    <h5>Summary</h5>
                    <p>I am 34 years old and started working at age 16 while attending high school.  For the better part of the past 18 years I have tackled varying combinations of simultaneous academic and professional pursuits.  In 2013, I graduated from UC Berkeley where I earned high scores, scholarships awarded for merit such as leadership, and entrance to a competitve internship program.  In my professional development, I rose to executive level positions and have been promoted more than six times.  Since 2014 I have invested the majority of my efforts in founding my own non-profit civic technology startup called Digital Citizen.  In my ongoing career I plan to continue my quest for greater excellence.  If you've read this far, there's already a chance we can achieve excellence together.</p>
                    </ul>
                <h5>Goal</h5>
                    <p>My long term goal is to build a career as a web developer, and become a project leader in civic technology or a closely related field.</p>
