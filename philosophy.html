                <p><center>In this section I casually share some of my broad personal opinions on how to be a positive force in the world while achieving success and happiness.</center></p>
                
                <h3 class="sectionheader">Perspective on Humanity</h3>
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">It's of critical importance that we all hold the perspective that human beings are inherently "good".  People wind up making a lot of mistakes and sometimes doing some terrible things, but I think that, generally speaking, most of us will want good things to happen for other people.  Many of us even make tremendous personal sacrifices to help others.  We are compassionate towards one another, but there's a wide variety of approaches on how to conduct ourselves when faced with situations like danger, inequity, and fear of uncertainty.  I think many of us lose sight of the vast majority of people who possess an astounding capacity for kindness and talents which they employ for benefit of everyone around them.  When we start to feel cynical about humanity, we create a "self-fulfilling prophecy" because we behave as though we cannot depend on others, and in many cases, this will cause a potentially dependable and trustworthy person to respond in kind.  If someone behaves as if they don't trust you, are you likely to trust them?  Most of us are typically trying to do what we believe is right.  We may have some lofty or misguided justifications for doing the wrong thing, but our desire to do good is at the core fibre of our being.</p>
                    
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">Since I believe that people are generally good, I tend to "give them the benefit of the doubt" when things go wrong.  I'm very patient with others, and greatly appreciate when they respond in kind.  If we make mistakes we're usually redeemable and most of us mean well even when we're misguided and erroneously cause harm to others.  When we hold the view that human beings are generally good, we respond by having higher default levels of trust, and we're more likely to invest in the well being of others.  I won't delve deeply into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract" class="bodytextlinks" style="text-decoration:none;" target= "_blank">social contract theory</a>, but I believe unwritten rules of human interdependence and trust are a major factor, if not the most important factor, determining our society's prospects for happiness and success.</p>
                    
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">Sadly, there are many people who believe it's a fierce "dog eat dog" world where the primary driving force of progress is ruthless competition.  I believe people who hold that misguided perspective probably wish they could express more of their compassion, but they're too afraid of being "eaten by another dog" if they let their guard down.  Perhaps they've had bitter experiences, or made observations from tragic events around them, causing them to conclude that it's a cruel world.  That's understandable, but even if it's true, the only way to begin making this world less cruel is by having patience and compassion for those who still think it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game" class="bodytextlinks" style="text-decoration:none;" target= "_blank">"zero-sum game"</a> full of either winners or losers.</p>
                
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">Don't get me wrong, I love competition.  I just don't think it's the best motivator for prosperity when the stakes for losers are so severe as death, poverty, or the impossibility of upward mobility.  Working together, we can all be winners, and together we'd win more than any individual could working alone.  In our society, the most "successul" individuals sometimes take for granted the necessary context in which their success has taken place, and the sacrifices of others who have fought to create and maintain that context. Whether we realize it or not, we're highly dependent on one another.</p>
                
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">These beliefs shape our regular behaviors and our attitude towards people, so having a positive work environment, maintaining friendships, and generally "getting by" in society depends heavily on how well we invest in our fellow humans.

                <h3 class="sectionheader">Life's Delicate Balance</h3>
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">If I am asked to sum up the key to living a happy life in one word, I would say it's all about "balance".  Finding and maintaining the right balance between all the competing forces in our lives is central to happy and healthy living.  I feel like the universe is sending us many obvious hints at this general principle.</p>
                
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">Within our bodies we constantly need to maintain various balances.  The acidity levels measured by pH balance are critical to health.  We need to maintain steady balanced heart rate, consumption of clean air, water, and nutrients and if any of those fall out of balance consequences to health can easily be severe as death.  This is a gross oversimplification of how the physiology of aging works, but essentially our bodies rely on maintenance of a delicate balance in which cell regeneration must continue at a rate matching cellular death (apoptosis).  As we age, cellular reproduction slows and the quality of replacement cells degrades eventually making us weaker and more successebtible to illness and death.  These are just a few examples of nature telling us how important balance can be.</p>
                    
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">Another example is in our environment.  For our sustained life on this planet we need to balance countless attributes of our ecosystem: oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, conditions of ground soil that provide for fertility, and balancing human developmental interests with natural preservation of wildlife and plant diversity.  With countless other examples, you get the idea...</p>
                    
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">I believe the principle of these examples remains consistent when it comes to matters of the human condition and interpersonal relations.  In order to lead happy healthy lives, we have to maintain balance in the activiites we perform.  A simple example is the balance of time spent on exercising ones brain versus exercising one's body.  Another simple example is our need to balance time alone with socializing.  There's also the popular notion of work-life balance, suggesting that we need to regularly have some leisure time in addition to working hard.  Furthermore, there's the concept of living in the present versus making sacrificial investments today for potentially greater benefits in the future.  If we chose only to live in the present, we might just want to have as much pleasure as possible, as immediately as possible, without concern for future consequences or outcomes.  Obviously, as some of us may have "learned the hard way", this can lead to sub-optimal results.  By stark contrast, if we lived too much for the future we could make ourselves miserable in the present, and this could be destructive because we may lose sight of the fact that every moment of our lives has value.  Sacrificing one moment for another may not really be worthwhile.  Sometimes, people sacrifice so much of their day-to-day lives in order to build a brighter future, they don't really know how to stop their pattern of deprivation so they never relax enough to enjoy their achievements.  The answer is to balance the way we spend our time in ways that celebrate the joy of each day, while also investing in the promise of a good future.  Sometimes we may choose to go through a period of sacrifice (for example, working insanely long hours in a coding bootcamp for three months), but before or after that period, it would be wise to take a vacation in order to maintain some balance and avoid burning out.
                    
                <p>In conclusion, this evidence is what drives my theory that, in just about every aspect of life, balance is key to prosperity.
