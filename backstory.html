                <h3 class="sectionheader">Work/School Timeline</h3>
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada but moved to San Francisco in 2000. At that time, I was about to graduate high school but was interrupted due to familial obligations.  My Canadian high school credits weren't directly transferrable, so I earned a GED and began attending classes on nights and weekends at the City College of San Francisco.  While attending community college in pursuit of my undergraduate degree, I was also working full time at Macy's where I started to develop a career.  During my five years at Macy's I was promoted twice, from Sales to Human Resources Training Specialist and finally to Department Manager. Despite my success in retail, I maintained my focus on school because I wanted to enhance my knowledge and skills.  It was my first time working within a large corporation and my quest for promotion introduced me to corporate politics, which inspired my interest in political science.</p>


                <p class="bodyparagraphs">My career continued to develop as I gained additional project management, training, quality assurance, and technical skills.  I was very happy with my professional development, but still wanted more, so I continued my rigorous schedule of work and night classes.  I challenged myself to work in a more impactful capacity to improve society.</p>


                <p class="bodyparagraphs">This division of my energy between work and school did come at a price (mainly because it delayed completion of my degree), but given my financial obligations at the time, I was unable to commit to completing my education faster by taking a full-time class schedule.  At several points in my career I attempted to attend school full-time but it wasn't until 2010 that I was able to resign from my post as Director of Training and Quality Assurance with Telecom Inc. and prepare myself for transfer to UC Berkeley.  In 2013, I earned my degree in Political Science.</p>


                <p class="bodyparagraphs">While in university, I discovered there is an urgent need for "civic technology" that would improve many processes of governance.  I began development of my own online tools (Digital Citizen - digiciti.org) which were focused on improving the quality of political deliberation among citizens.  Much of my research and studies at Berkeley were focused on improving civic engagement with the application of new technologies.  In my last semester, I joined a competitive academic program which sent me to an offsite campus in Washington DC, where I completed my remaining classes while working as a Web Producer intern at C-SPAN.  Even though my responsibilities were mostly journalistic and editorial, I was able to learn first hand what it was like to work in a political website development team.  I was offered an opportunity to stay at C-SPAN, but due to family obligations I needed to return to San Francisco.</p>


                <p class="bodyparagraphs">After graduating and leaving C-SPAN, I began to work on making my digiciti.org project come to life.  Finances at the time didn’t permit me to make a full-time commitment to the creation of digiciti.org.  In order to manage expenses, I worked in a simple part-time "sales ops" position for Verizon so that I could still invest energy into learning how to start a nonprofit organization, research the marketplace of existing civic engagement tools, prepare funding proposals, protect the intellectual property, learn fundamental web development and UX design skills, and actually produce prototypes with introductory media content.  After about a year of attempting to do this work while employed at Verizon, I knew there was no hope of completing this herculean task in a reasonable time frame without investing 100% of my focus to it.  I knew that getting funded and forming a team within a year was a long shot, but it had a better chance of success than never trying.  Countless civic tech startups have come and gone, and many never see the light of day.  Despite the risks, I decided to take a chance and I committed to working on the project full-time for a year.  I saved up enough money to afford my basic expenses and pursued my dream despite the high probability of failure.  In some sense, even though I wasn’t able to achieve the miracle of getting a fully funded nonprofit organization to form within a year, I still believe the project was a success because I learned so much and was able to create a foundation that I might build upon in the future. Furthermore, I’ve made a significant contribution to the difficult and important work that like-minded individuals are doing to improve civic engagement.  I passionately felt this was an effort I owed to my community, state, and country, particularly because I had received fully paid tuition via scholarships and grants when I attended Berkeley.  I wholeheartedly believe that creating digiciti.org, or a set of tools like it, would be the best way I could help people.</p>
                    
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">I'm currently working to build web development, programming, and technical skills that I will use to enter a new career as a web developer.  While working as a contractor with GitHub in their Education division, I've been studying basic web development languages including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Javascript.  In the future I hope to use these skills, and my increasing professional programming experience, to continue developing digiciti.org in my spare time.  I have found the learning process to be fun and exciting.  The stress and discomfort of struggling to figure out how to use various languages is easily overshadowed by the reward of "aha! moments" in which I solve a problem, learn new tricks, or create something cool that surprises me.</p>

                <h3 class="sectionheader">My Character</h3>
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">I'm 35 years old and have a wide range of experience in both my personal and professional life.  I consider myself fortunate, but life hasn't been without adversity.  However, I consistently overcame various personal and professional challenges when things were difficult, and I have always worked to challenge myself whenever life doesn't do it for me.  Indeed, my quest for knowledge and self-improvement never ends.  It is in this quest that I find my greatest satisfaction.</p>  
                    
                <p class="bodyparagraphs">I've travelled to various parts of the world and consider myself a student of life who strives to improve by making astute observations about the world around me.  I'm very analyitcal and constantly looking to learn life's lessons.</p>
