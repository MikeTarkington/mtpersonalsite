  <p style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 30">Adventure Time[nb 3] is an American animated television series created by Pendleton Ward for Cartoon Network. The series follows the adventures of a boy named Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio)—a dog with the magical power to change shape and size at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, wherein they interact with other major characters, including: Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch), the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), Marceline the Vampire Queen (voiced by Olivia Olson), and BMO (voiced by Niki Yang). The series is based on a short produced for Nicktoons and Frederator Studios' animation incubator series Random! Cartoons. After the short became a viral hit on the Internet, Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series that previewed on March 11, 2010, and officially premiered on April 5, 2010.</p>

  <p style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 30">The series draws inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons and video games. It is produced using hand-drawn animation, and episodes are created through the process of storyboarding. Multiple episodes are worked on concurrently, as each individual episode taking roughly eight to nine months to complete. The Adventure Time cast record their lines in group recordings and the series regularly employs guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each Adventure Time episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Seven seasons of the program have aired. The eighth season premiered on January 23, 2017, and the show has been renewed for one additional season. As of October 2015, a feature-length film is in development.</p>

  <p style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 30">Since its debut, Adventure Time has been a ratings success for Cartoon Network, with the highest-rated episodes having attracted over 3 million viewers. The show has received positive reviews from critics and—despite being aimed primarily at children—has developed a following among teenagers and adults. Adventure Time has won awards including six Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, two Annie Awards, two British Academy Children's Awards, a Motion Picture Sound Editors Award, a Pixel Award, and a Kerrang! Award. The series has also been nominated for three Critics' Choice Television Awards, two Annecy Festival Awards, a TCA Award, and a Sundance Film Festival Award, among others. A comic book spin-off based on the series won an Eisner Award and two Harvey Awards. The series has also inspired various clothing items and related merchandise, video games, comic books, and DVD compilations.</p>

  <p style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 30">On September 29, 2016, it was announced that the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its ninth season.[6]</p>
